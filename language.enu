P2M1VOX1=
	"Dr. Bellmer, my name is Colonel Stinson, with Legion: Earth. We don't have \n"
	"much time, so listen carefully. The mission to extract you from Black Mesa \n"
	"was compromised, and your Controller has gone AWOL, and possibly rogue. \n"
	"Unfortunately, we cannot mobilize a rescue mission yet, so you're on your \n"
	"own for now. Our surveillance indicates your crash site has only one way in \n"
	"or out. Therefore, your exit strategy is to return to Black Mesa while we \n"
	"attempt another extraction. Meanwhile, government and alien forces will \n"
	"continue to hunt you. There's a cavern nearby where you can seek cover \n"
	"until we can...";
P2M2VOX1=
	"Dr. Bellmer, you're at the employee in-processing facility. You may recall \n"
	"you went through here when you began your mission. The monorail will take \n"
	"you to back to Sector C. We'll try to regroup once you get there, and work \n"
	"out an effective way to extract you.";
P2M2VOX2=
	"That you, Dr. Bellmer? Looks like you're stuck here with the rest of us. \n"
	"They've disabled monorail and gate control. You can't get out that way. \n"
	"[Whoa! Did I just make a Han Solo reference?] You can try and make it \n"
	"through the canyon, but I wouldn't recommend it. Good luck.";
P2M3VOX1=
	"We didn't anticipate the total lockdown of Sector C. We can't send \n"
	"transport to your current location because the winds make flying \n"
	"exceedingly treacherous. Proceed through the canyon until you reach the \n"
	"dam. There are two ways out at that point, and we'll figure out your best \n"
	"option. Meanwhile, you're probably wondering who we are. I'm sending you an \n"
	"UnderNet link that will provide some background. As to why we're interested in \n"
	"you, that will be revealed in due time.";
P2M3VOX2=
	"Legion: Earth is an organization that was created to protect Earth from \n"
	"threats both extra-terrestrial and home-grown. In recent years, that threat \n"
	"has increased as a result of Anomalous Materials research at the Black Mesa \n"
	"facility in the United States and by the European Space Consortium. The \n"
	"discovery of PortalTech, otherwise known as teleportation, has allowed both \n"
	"these agencies to collaborate with an alien species in a Borderworld known \n"
	"as Xen. We have evidence that human dealings with this species are paving \n"
	"the way for an invasion of Earth. Our mandate is to stop it.";
P2M4VOX1=
	"Too bad you couldn't cross the dam and get out from there. It might have \n"
	"been easier to extract you from the East. Your best chance now is to take \n"
	"the sewers to the Weapons Test Lab. There's an open landing area there, and \n"
	"we can set a transport helicopter down. Government forces control strategic \n"
	"points, while the Xen aliens roam freely elsewhere. Watch your back. I'm \n"
	"sending you another UnderNet link with more information on us.";
P2M4VOX2=
	"Legion: Earth was first aware of Xen and human collaboration about a year \n"
	"ago. Then, we discovered that the European Space Consortium engineered an \n"
	"infiltration into Black Mesa with the objective of sabotaging the research \n"
	"there. The operative, one Dr. Rolf Bellmer, succeeded in corrupting vital \n"
	"data at Black Mesa. This gave the Consortium an edge in the race to harness \n"
	"alien technology. But Dr. Bellmer was a loose end, and the Consortium \n"
	"attempted to terminate him with extreme prejudice. This attempt failed, but \n"
	"Dr. Bellmer continues to remain embattled.";
P2M5VOX1=
	"Dr. Bellmer, follow these instructions carefully. When you exit the sewers, \n"
	"proceed to the East Gate. We'll have a helicopter transport waiting there to \n"
	"get you out.";
P2M5VOX2=
	"Damn! It seems your Controller is one step ahead of us. He has a lot to \n"
	"answer for. Those were good people we lost on that \n"
	"transport............................................ Okay, Plan B. You'll \n"
	"need to proceed through the Lambda Complex. The security key will probably \n"
	"be in the Administrator's office. And make sure you collect the \n"
	"experimental energy weapon they're developing before you head for Lambda.";
P2M6VOX1=
	"The Lambda Complex is a series of labs. Be mindful of the freezer section \n"
	"and don't stay in there for too long. Also, there's a rumor that your \n"
	"Controller may be trying to recruit other scientists to his cause. Do not \n"
	"engage him. I repeat, do not engage your Controller.";
P2M7VOX1=
	"You're approaching the core of the Lambda Complex. This is where they \n"
	"conduct experiments on live specimens. We'll try to set a transport down on \n"
	"the helipad leading to the East entrance. But you'll need a security key to \n"
	"make it through the checkpoint. I'm sending you a final UnderNet link that \n"
	"will make things clearer.";
P2M7VOX2=
	"Dr. Rolf Bellmer has proven to be extremely resourceful, both as an \n"
	"undercover operative, and as a combat technician. Moreover, he possesses a \n"
	"rare combination of advanced scientific knowledge and survivor's instinct, \n"
	"which makes him an ideal candidate for recruitment to Legion: Earth. In \n"
	"addition, his time at Black Mesa will give us valuable insights into \n"
	"operations at that facility, and will allow us to hobble their efforts.";
P2M7VOX3=
	"We think the security key is inside the central chamber where the Gargantua \n"
	"is in stasis. You'll need to disable the laser barrier and drop into the \n"
	"chamber to retrieve the key. With the malfunctioning door, the only way \n"
	"into the laser control room are the ducts. Find the Boiler Room next to the \n"
	"Fuel Storage area, and use the ventilation duct.";
P2M8VOX1=
	"They've cut power to most sectors, and drained the fuel from the emergency \n"
	"generators. You may find some fuel in the supply area in the North-East \n"
	"quadrant. But be careful: the place is swarming with government and alien \n"
	"forces.";
